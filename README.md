# 2018 Advent of Code Solutions - Python 3

My [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) solutions for 2018, written in Python 3.

I'll do my best to finish each exercise daily, but there's no guarantee.

Several utility functions are included in `util.py`, including a function that will grab the given input for a day. To use this function, the `AOC_SESSION_KEY` must be set. This key can be found in the site cookies, after you've logged in successfully. Input files are cached to the file system to reduce strain on the AoC server.

My input files, along with my unique answers are provided in each file. Occasionally, I'll go back and rewrite or refactor a solution. I'll try to include both versions for each day -- the quick and dirty, and the slightly more readable or more efficient. 

Disclaimer -- this code is meant to be written and run quickly, with minimal configuration. Therefore, the solutions may not always be the most Pythonic or idiomatic.
